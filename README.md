**What the app does:

* Gives the user a list of the products in the store.

    * Prompts the user to choose which product they would like to buy using the id number.

    * Asks the user how many they would like to buy.

      * If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
      * Yet, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
      * If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.
